# Principles-and-Implementation-of-Microcomputers-Final-Project
Assembler Functionality:

Translates assembly-like instructions into machine code.
Register Simulation:

Uses C++ variables to emulate assembly language registers.
Instruction Processing:

Handles instructions like MOV, NOP, DEC, XRL, DJNZ, and LJMP.
File Operations:

Reads instructions from an input file and writes machine code to an output file.
Label Management:

Identifies and manages labels for jump instructions.
Program Counter Management:

Updates the program counter to reflect the current instruction's memory position.
Educational Value:

Enhances understanding of C++ programming and low-level assembly language concepts.
Provides practical experience in code translation and register emulation.
