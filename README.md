# Principles-and-Implementation-of-Microcomputers-Final-Project
1.Assembler Functionality:
  Translates assembly-like instructions into machine code.
2.Register Simulation:
  Uses C++ variables to emulate assembly language registers.
3.Instruction Processing:
  Handles instructions like MOV, NOP, DEC, XRL, DJNZ, and LJMP.
4.File Operations:
  Reads instructions from an input file and writes machine code to an output file.
5.Label Management:
  Identifies and manages labels for jump instructions.
6.Program Counter Management:
  Updates the program counter to reflect the current instruction's memory position.
7.Educational Value:
  Enhances understanding of C++ programming and low-level assembly language concepts.
  Provides practical experience in code translation and register emulation.
